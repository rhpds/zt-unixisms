Now, letâ€™s try a few examples of converting between time formats. The
`+date+` command is useful for displaying the current date and time of
your system. The value output depends on the timezone you have
configured, and the format of the output can be controlled using format
strings. If you run `+date+` without any arguments, it will print the
date and time in the following format:

[source,bash]
----
date
----

____
_NOTE:_ The output should match the current date and time when you are
running this lab, but it will be formatted using the Eastern Timezone
since that is the default for the lab systems. Converting a date and
time to epoch time is as simple as a single argument (`++%s+`) with
`+date+`. You can also specify the `+-d+` option to input a datetime
instead of using the current one.
____

[source,bash]
----
date -d "Dec 12 2014 20:00:00" +%s
----

This will show you the epoch time corresponding to the string you input:

You can convert in the reverse direction with `+date+` as well by using
the `+--date+` option, then prepending a `+@+` symbol to the epoch time
you would like to convert. This syntax specifies that you would like to
know the date at the given epoch time. Try this using the epoch time you
just received from the previous command:

[source,bash]
----
date --date @1418432400
----

This results in the original date that you input a few commands ago.
Notice that this specifies the date in the timezone for this lab system,
Eastern Time.

An example of how you might run into unix time is available in this
https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/selinux-denial2[SELinux troubleshooting
article]. The following example error is given:

For this lab, we care about the second field in this error. You may
recognize that ten digit number as a unix timestamp. To confirm, convert
it to a standard date:

[source,bash]
----
date --date @1600796109
----

The article that this error was taken from was published on November 16,
2020, which supports the fact that this was a unix timestamp generated
during the process of writing the article. However, someone who is not
familiar with the unix time format may never consider that this number
relates to time at all.
