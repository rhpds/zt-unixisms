=== Date and Time

Now, letâ€™s try a few examples of converting between time formats. The
`date` command is useful for displaying the current date and time of
your system. The value output depends on the timezone you have
configured, and the format of the output can be controlled using format
strings. If you run `date` without any arguments, it will print the date
and time in the following format:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
date
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
Fri Mar  7 05:17:10 PM UTC 2025
----

NOTE: The output should match the current date and time when you are
running this lab, but it will be formatted using the Eastern Timezone
since that is the default for the lab systems. Converting a date and
time to epoch time is as simple as a single argument (`+%s`) with
`date`. You can also specify the `-d` option to input a datetime instead
of using the current one.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
date -d "Dec 12 2014 20:00:00" +%s
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
1418414400
----

This will show you the epoch time corresponding to the string you input:

You can convert in the reverse direction with `date` as well by using
the `--date` option, then prepending a `@` symbol to the epoch time you
would like to convert. This syntax specifies that you would like to know
the date at the given epoch time. Try this using the epoch time you just
received from the previous command:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
date --date @1418414400
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
Fri Dec 12 08:00:00 PM UTC 2014
----

This results in the original date that you input a few commands ago.
Notice that this specifies the date in the timezone for this lab system,
Eastern Time.
