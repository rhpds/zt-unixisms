=== Accessing Hidden Files

Sometimes it is useful to have a file or directory that it hidden,
meaning it does not show up when running ls normally.
This may be because the file is not often used, or because the file shouldn't be tampered with by inexperienced users.

Any file or directory that begins with a `.` such as the `~/.ssh/` directory from the last section will be
interpreted as hidden, and will only show up when using the `-a` option
with `ls`.

List the files in your current directory:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
ls
----

NOTE: If the directory is empty the command will execute without output.

Now, try it again with the `-a` option. Many more files and directories
will show up, even though you have not changed where you are looking.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
ls -a
----

.Output
[source,text,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
.  ..  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  .cache  .cshrc  .gnupg  .ssh  .tcshrc  .viminfo
----

Adding the `-a` option reveals that there are numerous hidden files and
directories in this home directory. These are hidden because they are
not files that you would interact with often, so there is no need for
them to clutter up *root*â€™s home directory visually. However, they are
data that is associated with the user, so it is beneficial from an
organization point of view to store them in the home directory
associated with their specific user.

NOTE: One common hidden directory you will commonly run into is the
`.git` directory. This is part of any git repository and stores data
used in version control for your local repository.

Creating a new hidden file or directory is quite simple, just start the
name with a `.`

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
touch .hidden-file
----

Now that this file is created, confirm that it only shows up when using
`ls -a`:

Test the file is hidden with `ls`.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
ls
----

This command has no expected output.

Run `ls -a` to see the file.

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
ls -a
----

.Output
[source,text,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
.  ..  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bash_profile  .bashrc  .cache  .cshrc  .gnupg .hidden-file  .ssh  .tcshrc  .viminfo
----
